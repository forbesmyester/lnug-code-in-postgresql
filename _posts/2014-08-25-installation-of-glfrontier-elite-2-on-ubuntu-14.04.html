<h2 id="h2-why">Why</h2><p>When I saw the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous">Elite Kickstarter</a> I knew about the old Elite games which I never played but I knew had an amazing reputation. I looked around the page watched some video's and decided to back it. Since then I have read all the news releases and watched all the video's Frontier have put out and I'm really getting quite excited by now!</p><p>Due to my pledge level I should be able to play the beta however because I am a Linux user I am probably going to have to wait a bit longer than most to be able to play it :-( For the time being I have decided to download one of the older Elite games to see what all the fuss was about.</p> <h2 id="h2-steps">Steps</h2><p>This page documents the process of getting glFrontier Elite 2 working on a modern Ubuntu 14.04 system, I expect that this process is what will also work for Mac's however I am guessing it's a bit tougher to get the development libraries etc installed.</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Install the required development libraries with <code>apt-get install build-essential libvorbis-dev</code></li><li>Download &quot;source code (OpenGL, SD:: unix, mingw)&quot; from <a href="http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html">http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html</a></li><li>Extract it with <code>tar -jxf frontvm2-20060623.tar.bz2</code></li><li>Enter the newly extracted directory</li><li>Type <code>make -f Makefile-C</code> to compile the code, it does print out quite a few warnings, but did work (at least for me)</li><li>At this point typing <code>./frontier</code> should launch the game, though it won't yet have any sound and will print lots of warnings about those missing sound files, so...</li><li>We now need to download and install the sound files, these are hosted on the same <a href="http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html">http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html</a> page under thane mame &quot;Sound effects and music (optional with the above). Download it.</li><li>While still in the extracted game directory untar the sound file, for me it was <code>tar -jxf ../frontvm-audio-20060222.tar.bz2</code> which rather annoyingly created a sub directory, so I had to <code>mv frontvm-audio-20060222/* .; rm -rf frontvm-audio-20060222</code> to clean that up.</li><li>Type <code>./frontier</code> and you have a fully working version of Frontier Elite 2!</li></ol><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li><a href="This%20page">http://tenleftfingers.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/playing-tom-mortons-glfrontier-on.html</a> was really helpful in getting the compile steps working.</li><li>I used <a href="http://www.frontierastro.co.uk/Hires/hiresfe2.html">http://www.frontierastro.co.uk/Hires/hiresfe2.html</a> for how to setup the sound</li><li>The main downloads are stored on <a href="http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html">http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html</a></li></ul><style>pre {     margin: 1em;     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0.5em;     border: 1px #AAA solid; }  pre code {     padding: 0 0; }  code {     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0 0.3em; } </style>
