<p>In general when I am developing I tend to have unit test results on the right with my code on the left as apposed to having two files open. This means I tend to use <code>C-^</code> keystroke a lot, which is jump back to last buffer in VIM.</p><p>The last few days I have been investigating <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> following <a href="https://twitter.com/LNUGorg/status/63 6624771862687744">Tim Perry's LNUG talk</a> but I found that the <a href="https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi">Quramy/tsuquyomi VIM plugin</a> overrides the <code>C-^</code> keyboard mapping... which is pretty painful for me.</p>                                                                                         <p>So I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi/pull/36">GitHub pull request</a> to add an option to disable all key mappings. The feature its elf which is now unbound for me looks really useful, as do the other bindings so I will probably map them later on to different keys if TypeScript goes from a brief investigation into something I end up using long term...</p>
