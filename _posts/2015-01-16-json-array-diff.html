<p>For most of my working life I've been doing RDD (refresh driven development) but in the last 3-4 years I've been using more and more TDD. It's got to the point that pretty much all functionality new that I write is written using TDD, life is sooooooo much better but recently I've found myself staring at big JSON documents trying to figure out why <code>expected</code> is not equal to <code>result</code> four levels deep. This is not fun and it's also not a good use of time so I decided that I needed to come up with a solution...</p><p>I created a little bash script called <code>json-array-diff</code>. The code itself is shown below:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash<br />[ $# -ge 1 -a -f &quot;$1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; input=&quot;$1&quot; || input=&quot;-&quot;<br />JSON=$(cat $input | grep &#39;DIFFTHIS: &#39; | sed &#39;s/.*DIFFTHIS\:\s*\[/[/&#39;)<br /><br />JSONA=$(echo $JSON | jq -S &quot;.[0]&quot; &gt; /tmp/${USER}-a.json)<br />JSONB=$(echo $JSON | jq -S &quot;.[1]&quot; &gt; /tmp/${USER}-b.json)<br /><br />meld /tmp/${USER}-a.json /tmp/${USER}-b.json</code></pre><p>This horrid bash code takes the input from STDIN and looks for the text 'DIFFTHIS: ' within it and then uses <code>sed</code> to remove it... as long as the next non-whitespace character is a '['. Why before a '['? Well the text from 'DIFFTHIS: ' until the end of the line is intended to be a JSON document including the expected and actual results. Next we use <code>jq</code> to rip the first and second elements from that array and write them to temporary files in <code>/tmp</code> and finally use <code>meld</code> (my preferred diffing program) to show the differences between the two files.</p><p>This give me the not-perfect but far better workflow of:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Write a new test.</li><li>It fails.</li><li>Hack away on code till I get something that looks like it might just work.</li><li>It spews out 4K of JSON data which I can't diff with my eyes.</li><li>Swear.</li><li>Add the text snippet <code>console.log(&quot;DIFFTHIS: &quot;, JSON.stringify([expected, result]))</code> to my test just above the failing line.</li><li>Re-run test</li><li><code>meld</code> pops up making it super easy for me to spot the error.</li><li>Fix the code, it's easy now I know what I messed up!</li></ol><p>You can download the script <a href="from%20GitHub">https://github.com/forbesmyester/provisioning-common/blob/master/roles/terminal_developer/files/scripts/json-array-diff</a> hope it stops you staring :-)</p> <style>pre {     margin: 1em;     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0.5em;     border: 1px #AAA solid; }  pre code {     padding: 0 0; }  code {     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0 0.3em; } </style>
