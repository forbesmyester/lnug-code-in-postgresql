title: Great Emulator Frontend
tag:

After struggling with libretro / retroarch I've settled on Attract-Mode for my emulator frontend but couldn't find a good package for my Debian Stable system.  Luckily compilation was easy...   ``` sudo apt-get install  libsfml-dev libopenal-dev  zlib1g-dev vflib3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libopengl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev checkinstall make checkinstall ```  Running was not immediately obvious... It could not find the default font, failing with `Error, could not find default font`. Launching with `attract -f Meslo` fixed it up.
