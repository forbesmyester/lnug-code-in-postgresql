Martin) about Design Patterns at SkillsMatter. In it he gives what appeared to be a completely unrehearsed a run through of some of the design patterns volunteered by the audience.</p><p>It's rare that you get such great speakers with such experience, rarer still when the event is free and I feel very lucky to have been able to be there.</p><p>If you didn't make it and want the next best thing you can <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/in-the-brain-of-uncle-bob">watch it online</a>... There's other videos of Uncle Bob too, which I'm looking forward to watching very soon.</p>
