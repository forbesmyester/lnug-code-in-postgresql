<p>I am currently (and have been for a long time) in a state of flux with my current editor selection... For a while about 6 months ago I thought I would end up using VIM and even started reading a book about it. I learnt about VIM Golf, the amazing &quot;.&quot; command, Tim Pope's awesome Surround...</p><p>I've learnt a lot about VIM but somewhere along the line it beeped at me one too many times and I felt compelled to go to something a bit more modern. I am currently trying out <a href="http://brackets.io/">Adobe's Brackets.io</a> which has some neet features and even has a form of a Surround plugin which will surround your currently selected text, but the missing out is how to getting that selection.</p><p>What was needed was a way to quickly and easily easily select text... it needed VIM's select-textobject function... So I created it!!! (or at least something similar)</p><p>If you don't know VIM text objects,Here's an example of what it can do Bold itels are selections.</p><p>Suppose I have the following input:</p><p><span class="sto_code cursor">&lt;p&gt;I have some &lt;span&gt;Text (that I want t<strong>|</strong>o select)&lt;/span&gt; here&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>I could use &quot;<code>iw</code>&quot; for inner word:</p><p><span class="sto_code">&lt;p&gt;I have some &lt;span&gt;Text (that I want <strong>to</strong> select)&lt;/span&gt; here&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>I could use &quot;<code>i(</code>&quot; for inside a bracketted area:</p><p><span class="sto_code">&lt;p&gt;I have some <strong>&lt;span&gt;Text (that I want to select)&lt;/span&gt;</strong> here&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>I could use &quot;<code>it</code>&quot; for inside a tag:</p><p><span class="sto_code">&lt;p&gt;I have some &lt;span&gt;<strong>Text (that I want to select)</strong>&lt;/span&gt; here&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>I could use &quot;<code>at</code>&quot; for a tag:</p><p><span class="sto_code">&lt;p&gt;I have some <strong>&lt;span&gt;Text (that I want to select)&lt;/span&gt;</strong> here&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>I could use &quot;<code>a&lt;p</code>&quot; to select the the &quot;<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&quot; tag:</p><p><span class="sto_code">&lt;p&gt;<strong>I have some &lt;span&gt;Text (that I want to select)&lt;/span&gt; here</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>Which is of course identical in this case to &quot;<code>i2t</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>2t</code>&quot;:</p><p><span class="sto_code">&lt;p&gt;<strong>I have some &lt;span&gt;Text (that I want to select)&lt;/span&gt; here</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</span></p><p>If you have Brackets.io installed you can go to <em>File &gt; Extension Manager</em> and search for &quot;select text object&quot; and it will come up. You can also get the source, as always <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/js.forbesmyester.select-textobject">at GitHub</a>. It goes really well with the &quot;Brackets Surround&quot; and &quot;Brackets Key Remapper&quot; plugins.</p><style>span.sto_code strong { background-color: #55F; } span.sto_code.cursor strong { background-color: #000; } span.sto_code {     font-family: monospace;     margin: 1em;     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0.5em;     border: 1px #AAA solid;     padding: 0 0;     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0 0.3em; } </style>
