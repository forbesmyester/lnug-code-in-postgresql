<p>I am intending to take the <a href="http://todomvc.com/labs/architecture-examples/react/">React demonstration</a> from <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a> and use it as a basis for demonstrating SyncIt. To enable me to do this I have released two seperate pieces of code, which for contractual reasons were always integrated directly into SyncIt and are now available seperately via GitHub and Bower. These are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/getTLIdEncoderDecoder">getTLIdEncoderDecoder</a> which is a way to generate &quot;Locally unique, shorter, sortable timestamp based Id's&quot;.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/manip">Manip</a> which is a way to manipulate nested data in a way reminiscent of MongoDB's &quot;Update Operators&quot; work (eg. <code>$set</code>, <code>$unset</code>, <code>$push</code> and <code>$inc</code>)&quot;.</li></ul><style>pre {     margin: 1em;     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0.5em;     border: 1px #AAA solid; }  pre code {     padding: 0 0; }  code {     background-color: #DDD;     padding: 0 0.3em; } </style>
